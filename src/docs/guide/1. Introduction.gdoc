The Mock plugin adds support for adding "mock" authentication to a Grails applications that uses Spring Security.  It depends on the Spring Security Core plugin.

This is helpful when the spring security implementation is tied to localized infrastructure such as LDAP, CAS, Shibboleth, or something of the like.

The username and roles mocked up by the plugin are configurable within your Config.groovy file.

It is suggested that you restrict spring security to only allow access from localhost when using this plugin to prevent unwanted access to your application when authentication is being bypassed.

It is recommended that you wrap the configuration settings for this pluggin to only load when in development, or possibly test mode.
